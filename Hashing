Hashing in Java is a technique for mapping data to a secret key, that can be used as a unique identifier for data. 
It employs a function that generates those keys from the data; this function is known as the Hash-function, 
and the output of this function (keys) is known as Hash-values. 
To provide quick access to the data, we store it as key(Hash values) value(real data) pairs in an array called Hash-table, 
which uses keys as indexes and values as the data to be stored at each index location.

//frequency counter to query freq of element from array without HashMap 
//TC : This method iterates over the full array of size 'N' for each of the 'Q' queries ,
//so the time complexity will be O(N*Q) .

public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] a = {1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4}; //given Array
    int[] queries = {4,1};
    //below loops run with TC O(N*Q) and SC = 0
    for (int i = 0 ; i < queries.length ;i++) {
        int qry = queries[i];
        int frq = 0;
        for (int j = 0 ; j < a.length ; j++) {
            if (a[j] == qry) frq++;
            }
            System.out.println(qry + " " + frq);
        }

data ---------> Hash Function ------------ > HashValue (Key) 
Key(HashValue) is unique identifier of the data .
(key,data)  pair is stored in array called HashTable as key as indexes and values as the data to be stored at that index.
Hashing is basically as data structure that stores data effitiently to solve problems. TC O(1)

//Time Complexity : As we are running a single for loop , O(N) time is required , to answer all the queries , we iterate over the queries and answer each one of them in O(1) time as we have all the answers pre calculated :-) 
//So , total time taken : O(N+Q).

//Space Complexity : We created an extra array of size 'N' , which is array 'b' . So space taken is O(N) by the algorithm.

HashSet stores unique elements without any associated values, while HashMap stores key-value pairs where the keys are unique identifiers and the values are associated data.

HashSet is a collection that stores unique elements, meaning it does not allow duplicate values. It is implemented using a hash table, which means the elements are stored in a hash table using their hash code as the key. This makes it very efficient to add, remove, and search for elements.
In a HashSet, the elements are not stored in any particular order. This means that when you iterate over the elements, the order in which you receive them is not guaranteed. 
HashSet does not provide any methods to retrieve the elements in a specific order.

HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in a hash table. 
It allows you to access the values based on the keys, and it guarantees constant time complexity for most operations. 
This means that HashMap is particularly useful when you need to quickly retrieve data based on a specific key.
In a HashMap, the keys are unique, but the values may be duplicated. This means that you can have multiple keys with the same value.
Like HashSet, HashMap does not provide any methods to retrieve the elements in a specific order.

[C++]unordered_set<int> b : On an average , each operation like insert , find and delete takes O(1) time on average . 
Worst Case can take O(N) time for each operation but it rarely occurs.

[C++]set<int> b : On an average , each operation like insert , find and delete takes O(logN) time on average . 
Worst Case will also take O(logN) time for each operation . 
Thats the advantage over unordered_set<int>b. All elements are stored in sorted order.

In Java, properties of HashSet is very similar to that of unordered_set in C++. 
It implements set interface which ensures no duplicate elements are present in hashset. 
The insertion of an object in hashset is based on its hash value, therefore when you iterate over hashset the order of elements that you'll get will most probably be different than how they were entered in the hashset. 
Hash value is the unique value of an object generated by a hash function to uniquely identify an object.

[Java]HashSet<Integer> set : Average time complexity for add, remove and look-up operation of HashSet is O(1). 
Worst case time complexity is O(N) which rarely occurs.

[Java]TreeSet<Integer> set : On an average , each operation like insert , find and delete takes O(logN) time on average .
Worst Case will also take O(logN) time for each operation. Thats the advantage over HashSet<Integer> set. All elements are stored in sorted order.


In C++, unordered_map<int,int> b : On an average , each operation like insert , find and delete takes O(1) time on average .
Worst Case can take O(N) time for each operation but it rarely occurs. 

map<int,int> b : On an average , each operation like insert , find and delete takes O(logN) time on average . 
Worst Case will also take O(logN) time for each operation . 
Thats the advantage over unordered_map<int,int> b. All keys maintain sorted order.

In Java, HashMap<Integer, String> map : Average time complexity is O(1) and worst case time complexity is O(n). 
Similar to unordered_map in C++.
