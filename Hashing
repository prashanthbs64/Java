Hashing in Java is a technique for mapping data to a secret key, that can be used as a unique identifier for data. 
It employs a function that generates those keys from the data; this function is known as the Hash-function, 
and the output of this function (keys) is known as Hash-values. 
To provide quick access to the data, we store it as key(Hash values) value(real data) pairs in an array called Hash-table, 
which uses keys as indexes and values as the data to be stored at each index location.

data ---------> Hash Function ------------ > HashValue (Key) 
Key(HashValue) is unique identifier of the data .
(key,data)  pair is stored in array called HashTable as key as indexes and values as the data to be stored at that index.
Hashing is basically as data structure that stores data effitiently to solve problems.
